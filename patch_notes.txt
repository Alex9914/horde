Dank Patch Notes 2.1.0

TL:DR
• Dank skip trader by pressing Alt + F4, Perk skill queueing and buffering, Melee weapon base changes, ArcCW attachments menu, Overlord overhauled, Warden, Shotguns, Berserker, Psycho, Hatcher, Engineer, Gunslinger, VDank update for zambies and bosses, fixed joining other servers potentially deranking your single player save if your rank was lower.

Gameplay Changes
Perk skill and Gadget queueing and buffering
• Players can now queue up or buffer their next Perk skill or Gadget if used while on cooldown. If used 0.5 second too early, the game will wait until it’s off cooldown to use said Perk skill or Gadget.
• Players can now hold down their key/button to queue up their next Perk skill or Gadget. As long as the player is holding down their key/button, the game will immediately use said Perk skill or Gadget whenever it’s off cooldown.
• Queueing and buffering doesn’t work on Perk skills or Gadgets that have less than 1 second cooldown.

Dank Skip Timer
• Players can now skip trader time by hitting F4, typing “!skip” or “!ready”, or typing in the console, “horde_skip_trader” (you can also bind it to a key or button too if).

Remaining Enemies
• Last 10 remaining enemies no longer display a glowing halo and now instead display them in full solid color. This is a million times more performance friendly and shouldn’t need to be turned off, hopefully.

Single Player Save File
• Your local single player rank save file will no longer incorrectly sync subclasses levels when joining other servers (You can still potentially derank subclasses if you play on a server with an older version of Horde, so be sure to copy your rank file if you play single player).

ArcCW Attachments Shop Changes
• Players can now buy Horde attachments through the ArcCW attachments window. Players can also still buy attachments through the Horde attachments shop.
• Fixed and removed all default whitelist for ArcCW attachments making it so players can now buy certain attachments that were previously not available before.
• Players can use, “horde_testing_attachment_copy“ and right click the attachments in the ArcCW attachments window to copy the correct ArcCW attachment name to make their own whitelist if they’re crazy enough to do so.

Hit Groups
• Player’s minions will now always do 100% of their damage no matter the body part they hit (headshots still do 200% of their damage). This makes it so things like turrets aren’t punished for shooting at zombie’s legs or arms dealing 25% of their damage due to only being able to aim center mass.
• Melee Weapons will now always do 100% of their damage vs limbs. This makes it so meleeing enemies doesn’t feel like hot doo doo as you actually did more damage by missing the enemy to not get penalized by the 25% limb damage. Headshots still do 200% damage.
• Shotguns will now deal 75% of their damage vs arms and 50% of their damage vs legs. This change only affects default Horde shotguns and not new shotguns added in via item config.

Melee Weapon Framework Changes
• Melee weapons now use their own hitbox system fixing multiple bugs and unintended interactions.
• Slightly fixed phantom hits from happening whenever players would hit at the edge of the enemy’s hull box (It’s still there but a lot less common now).
• Fixed the omega dank sniper rifle melee bug. May you rest in pepperonis, my dank bug.
• Melee weapons can now cleave multiple enemies depending on their weapon type and have different hitbox and reach distances.
• Melee weapons now have durability and will deal half damage when at zero durability. (This only affects Horde melee weapons)
• One durability is consumed per enemy hit with that melee weapon. Special effects do not consume durability (example: Mjolnir’s right click charged attack).
• Power attacks (right mouse click) will consume double the durability.
• Durability can be restored by opening up the Horde shop or picking up ammo boxes which will restore 20% of the weapon’s max durability.
• If you have Horde ammo boxes disabled, melee weapon durability will also be disabled.

Skull tokens
• Notification is now sent to the player when they pick up a skull token
• Skull tokens now spawn on top of the player rather than at the enemy’s location.

General
• Players will no longer drop their weapons at the end of each wave due to being over default maximum carry weight.
• Gadgets are now taken into account for maximum carry weight from weight modification skills.
• Item sell value is increased from 25% to 75% of the original price value.
• Players can no longer gain money from healing other players while the game has not started or during break time.


Perks
Overlord
• Overlord has been slightly reworked/improved.
• Fixed base Perk levels not being calculated.
• Overlord now gains +1 Fear stack for every wave that unlocks a new perk tier. This also removes all perk skills that increase Fear stacks to accommodate this change.
• Fixed a lot of internal things that nobody will care about (This is mainly how your presence works).
• Enemies and allies now immediately get debuffed or buffed the moment they go into your presence instead of once every 0.5 second.
• Overlord now starts with Dark Energy Blast but has a 30 second cooldown.
• Fixed Dark Energy Blast being way too dank, hitting and exploding multiple times.
• Overlord now has a faint sphere rendered around the player to display their presence area.
• Overlord now has their own special array of Gadgets and special upgrades that can be viewed from the shop.
• Fixed and removed Militant having leftover code causing you to heal 1 health whenever you receive any debuff buildup. 
• Inverse Filter now heals 3 health instead of 2 health whenever you receive any buildup (Moved the health gained on debuff buildup from Militant to Inverse Filter).
• Fixed Dispersion not working at all.
• Militant has new effects.
• Oppressor has new effects.
• Dark Energy Blast perk skill has new effects.
• Juxtaposition has new effects. It now instead creates a Combine minion with its own shotgun and will only shoot at enemies equal to your presence range. This also fixes weapons that can’t be duplicated to make custom configs more friendly.
• Doomed Presence has new effects.
• Death Eater has new effects.

Warden
• Warden Aura now uses a different base (similar to Overlord) for aura effect and should fix some rare scenarios where it doesn’t get applied to players.
• Warden Aura is now a sphere rather than a cube.
• Warden now has a faint sphere rendered around the player to display their aura.
• Warden Aura units increased from 160 to 205 to compensate for the loss of area.
• Fixed Warden’s block not adding to existing block value.

Hatcher
• Fixed Antlion AI from breaking causing them to stop attacking and just staring at you.
• Antlions now follow you a lot better and will teleport to you if multiple Antlions get stuck on each other.
• Fixed Antlion’s hitbox allowing you to target it (example: healing it with medkit or target it with gadgets). This also fixes Antlions clumping up together due to not having a collision bounding box.
• Fixed Antlions not adjusting their stats when upgrading your Pheropod while they are alive.
• Antlions can no longer use melee attacks and will only use ranged attacks.
• Antlions now lead enemies with their ranged attacks.
• Fix a bug where Antlions would continue evolving at max evolution, resetting their health back to maximum health.
• Antlions are now immune to all status effects.
• Fixed Antlion’s ranged attacks not healing themselves. Ranged attacks now heal themselves for 5% of their max health (this healing doesn’t evolve them and is similar to their Bug Pulse healing).
• Antlion’s evolution value will carry over to the next evolution if any.
• Added Hatcher’s Pheropods the ability to regenerate charges while holstered at 1/4th the regeneration speed (1 ammo every 1 second).
• Fixed Antlion’s ranged attacks not being affected by their owner’s outgoing healing effects (Example: Amplified healing).
• Antlions now use the new dank explosion code for their ranged attacks. This allows them to do their full damage adding a minimum damage range formula. This roughly gives them 25% more damage. It also fixes the number damage position too.
• Increased Antlion Guardian (Stage 4) maximum health from 800 to 900.
• HUD now shows Antlion's health while not in single player (Similar to SpecOps or Medic HUD).

SpecOps
• Fixed Neuron Stabilizer being able to transfer to other perks. Rest in pepperonis, Neuron Stabilizer. My favorite unintended interaction, you were too beautiful for this world.

Dank Update 2.0.0



-- New Framework and Mechanics --



-- Perks that have access to their special grenades can now throw their grenades via the quicknade hotkey, “G” by default. Or bind, “horde_use_quick_grenade” to a key/button. You can also disable the default quick grenade key by typing, “"horde_disable_default_quick_grenade_key 1" into the console command.

-- Classes and Subclasses now use their own whitelist pools giving them their own unique shop config. If you use your own custom config, you’ll have to set them up again for the subclasses unfortunately.

-- Screen effects now use a border hud like system for the base framework (it currently only affects when being healing, as other screen effects will come in future perk updates such as Psycho’s Frenzy Mode screen effect).

-- Area of effects such as explosions now use a different formula that allows better control over drop off damage and entity detection (only the framework is here and is meant for future perk updates).

-- Items and Gadgets that are automatically stripped (swapping classes) are now instead automatically sold. Gadgets that are purchased while you already have a gadget are now automatically sold (you’ll still need to have the amount of money to buy it but the correct amount of money will be deducted or refunded after purchase).



-- Gameplay Changes --


-- Ammo boxes will now restore secondary ammo reserves (secondary ammo reserves are ammunition used by equipment like underbarrel grenade launchers).



-- Weapon Changes --



-- Medkit --

-- Medkit will now consume up to 20 charges to heal up to 20% of your maximum health and scale accordingly to how much charges are remaining instead of requiring a flat 20 charges to heal a flat 20 amount of health.

-- Medkit now works while holding your fire button so you don’t have to spam it.

-- Medkit now requires you to have a target in order to heal your target (this means that you can hold your left mouse and flick your mouse and it will instantly heal your target if there is an eligible target.

-- Medkit weight is now 0.

-- Medkit purchase cost is now 0.

-- Every class now starts with a Medkit.

-- You cannot drop Medkits and swapping classes no longer drops it (you can still sell it to get rid of it).

-- Medkit is destroyed upon dropping it.

-- You can no longer use Medkit if you’re at 100% maximum health or at maximum overhealed health (this prevents you from wasting Medkit charges).

-- Fixed ammo boxes being eaten due to Medkits never having a full ammo reserve.



-- Grenades --

-- Throwing your last grenade never gets rid of your grenade, allowing you to still pick up ammo boxes to refill your grenades. You’ll still have a grenade in your hand while having zero grenades so rip your immersion.

-- Grenades now have 2 different throwing modes.

-- Primary fire (default - left mouse button) will not cook your grenade and throw your grenade at full velocity while having full bounce effect.

-- Secondary fire (default - right mouse) will cook your grenade and throw your grenade at full velocity while having a dampened effect, which will backspin your grenade causing it to cancel most of its momentum.

-- Quick grenades will throw grenades at a significantly lower velocity while having a dampened effect. 

-- Grenades can no longer be dropped (you can still sell it to get rid of it)

-- Grenades are destroyed upon dropping it.

-- Maximum special grenade reserve capacity limited to 9 grenades

-- Most grenades have had their fuse time set to 2 seconds with the exception of stun grenades which have 1.25 seconds.

-- Assault and SpecOps stun grenades no longer flashbangs yourself or others, destroy your ears or other ears, nor deal damage to yourself or enemies.

-- Stun grenades now always have full stun buildup power (this means it will always stun the enemy no matter the difficulty as long as their internal stun cooldown is off cooldown).
